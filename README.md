# K-Means Clustering From Scratch

This is a machine learning project done as part of CS2810, Mathematics for Data Models that I did during the Fall 2021 Semester.
The program implements the K-Means Clustering algorithm, as well as taking in sample data, applying the clustering algorithm, and outputting the results in a visual format. I used Python and several Python libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, and more.
